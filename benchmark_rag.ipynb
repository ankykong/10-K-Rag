Calculate the total number of shares held by non-affiliates:\\n\\nAssuming that all shareholders (23,838) except Apple's executives and directors are non-affiliates, we can estimate the number of shares held by non-affiliates to be approximately 12,600,000 - x, where x is the number of shares held by Apple's executives and directors. Let's assume that this number is around 1-2% of total outstanding shares (conservative estimate). This means x ≈ 126,000 - 252,000.\\n\\n2. Calculate the aggregate market value:\\n\\nAggregate Market Value = Number of Shares × Average Price Paid Per Share\\n\\nUsing the average price paid per share as of September 24, 2022 ($155.59), we can calculate the aggregate market value as follows:\\n\\nAggregate Market Value ≈ (12,600,000 - x) × $155.59\\n≈ $1,937,419,700 - ($x × $155.59)\\n\\nPlease note that this calculation is an estimate and may not reflect the actual aggregate market value of voting and non-voting stock held by non-affiliates as of March 29, 2019.\\n\\nAnswer: Approximately $1,937,419,700 (rounded to the nearest hundred thousand)\"},\n",
